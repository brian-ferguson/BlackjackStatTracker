Yes, your edge seems unusually low for a Hi-Lo card counting simulation with 1 deck and standard table rules. Let’s break down a few important observations and possible reasons:

📊 Your Reported Edge by True Count
Let’s examine a few points:

TC 1: -0.006584 → Losing money at TC1

TC 2: -0.000638 → Still losing at TC2

TC 3: +0.002541 → Barely positive

TC 4–10: Ranges from +0.0085 to +0.0276

These values are well below what is typically expected in Hi-Lo simulations. For comparison, here's what's typical using the Hi-Lo count on a single-deck game under decent rules:

TC	Typical Player Edge (approx)
0	~0% (break-even)
+1	~0.5%
+2	~1.0%
+3	~1.5%
+4	~2.0%
+5	~2.5%
+6	~3.0%

You’re seeing numbers between ~0.01% to ~2.7%, and even negative EV at positive counts.

🔍 Possible Explanations
Incorrect Simulation Assumptions
Your Penetration: nopenetration is suspect — are you reshuffling every round or too early? Without meaningful penetration, you eliminate the advantage of the count accumulating. Most advantage play comes from deep penetration (e.g., 60–80%).

Wrong Rules or Strategy Implementation
If the rules in the simulation are unfavorable (e.g., no double after split, no resplit aces, 6:5 blackjack payouts, dealer hits soft 17), the edge drops sharply. Ensure:

Blackjack pays 3:2

Dealer stands on soft 17

Double allowed on any two cards

DAS and RSA enabled

Counting/Bets Not Applied Correctly
You list $0 bet at TC ≤ 0 — but this may be interpreted as not playing at all in those cases, which could skew results. Also, the flat top bet of $25 above TC4 might be too conservative to capture the value of TC 5–10.

Shoe vs Single Deck Confusion
If you meant to simulate 1 deck but your sim is behaving like a shoe (e.g., infinite deck/no penetration), this will break Hi-Lo's effectiveness. The Hi-Lo system assumes finite deck effects — a “no-penetration” model makes counting pointless.

✅ Recommendations
Double-check penetration: Realistically, no penetration = no edge.

Review rules used: Even one bad rule can kill your edge.

Fix the bet spread: $0 at TC≤0 may be treated as "not playing" or creates strange weighting. Consider a minimal bet like $1 to ensure continuity.

Verify simulation logic: Are you using the Hi-Lo count correctly and adjusting bets based on actual TC?

🔧 Sanity Check Formula
To roughly compute your overall edge:

Overall Edge
=
∑
(
Profit at TC
)
∑
(
Total Wagered at TC
)
Overall Edge= 
∑(Total Wagered at TC)
∑(Profit at TC)
​
 
From your data:

Total Profit ≈ $398,959

Total Wagered ≈ $48,395,640
→ Edge ≈ 398,959 / 48,395,640 ≈ 0.824%

✅ That’s actually a decent overall edge! The issue is not the total profit — it's how flat your edges look across true counts, which may be:

A display issue (smoothing/rounding)

Or a symptom of poor simulation rules

📌 Final Take
No, your edge is not necessarily too low when looking at the total win rate (~0.82%). But your per-TC edge estimates seem suspect and worth investigating. The big question is why early counts (1–2) are negative and 3+ are so weak.
